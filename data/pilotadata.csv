This HIT is a psychology experiment sponsored by Stanford University. In order to consent to participate, you MUST meet the following criteria:


* 18 years of age or older.

* Fluent speaker of English.

* Have not participated in this experiment before.



The experiment investigates how people make sense of relationships among factors. It involves reading hypotheses about how different factors may be related to each other, looking at tables with statistical data and answering a few questions. The study takes about 15 min to complete, for which you will receive $2.50.



Your participation in this research is voluntary. You may refrain from answering any questions that make you uncomfortable and may withdraw your participation at any time without penalty. Other than monetary compensation, participating will provide no direct benefits to you. But, this research will help us understand various cognitive processes, which may benefit society in a number of ways, including influencing legal and public policy. 

We will not be asking for any personally identifying information, and we will handle responses as confidentially as possible. However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet.



By selecting the “consent” button below, I acknowledge that I am 18 or older, that I am a fluent speaker of English, that I have not completed this experiment before,  that I have read this consent form, and that I agree to take part in the research.","How much do you agree with the following statement about what causes zelmos’ antennas to become sore?:
